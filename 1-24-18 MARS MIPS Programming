addi $t0,$0,123 # $t0<- 0 +123
addi $t1,$0,10 # #t1<- 0+10 into t1  addi=add immediate
add $10, $t0,$t1 #sum t0 and t1 and put in t2
addi- useful when trying to put a number into a register
addu= unsigned add
subu= unsigned sub
div= divides puts quotient into lo register, remainder put in hi register
second step to movee to general register
mflo - move lo to general
mfhi- move hi to general
mult-multiply

pseudo instructions
li -load immediate value into register
move - copy value from one register to another

I/O 
  syscall(takes no operands)
  - I/O service is determined by value in $v0 must put value in in v0 to tell what type of data type
  - may result in changing register
  - $a0 is where you put the integer you want to print 
  -v0 gets overwritten with result.
  - terminate execution 
        li $v0 10
        syscall
  branch on equal instruction
    -beq $reg1, $reg2, target
    if reg1=reg2 go to target
    targets are labels.
