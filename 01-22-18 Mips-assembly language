ISA contact between hardware and software
specifies hardware resources
  - memory, registers
ISA doesn't specify how things are implemented
  - physical
  -electrical
  - speed, temp
advantages to ISA
  - allows software to work on any microarchitecture
  - provides binary compatibility
  - even if source code no longer available 
MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA)
 -Microprosser without Interlocked Pipeline Stages
 -RISC, Reduced Instruction Set Computer
 MIPS ISA : Memory
  - Organized in Bytes
  -Each byte has an address
  - bits are dont have an address
  a word=4 bytes
  big endian byte order: big end most significant byte comes first in order.
  little endian  small end comes firsst
  MIPS is bi-endian does either based on CPU setting. Mars does little endian.
  Registers
    - small, fast memory device inside CPU
    - 32 general-purpose registers each storing 32 bits
    - Register 0 always contains 32 zeros
  Special Registers
    - PC-Program Counter
    - hi and lo 
      - used by multiply and divide instructions
 syntax:
  label : operation operand, operand
  label is optional 
    -can jump to labels
  comments starts with #
  start:
        add $t2,$t0,$t1
